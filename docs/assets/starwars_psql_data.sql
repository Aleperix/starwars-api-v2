The Geonosian picadors steered the acklay toward Obi-Wan, who was able to outmaneuver the beast. A clumsy yet powerful strike from one of its claws sheered the chains that bound Kenobi. The beast continued to pursue the Jedi Knight, rending large holes in the hard-packed sand with its vicious stabs. It even shrugged off a pike attack, chomping through the offending polearm with bestial rage.

Its well-muscled underbelly conceals a ghastly gash of a mouth filled with sharp teeth, and a pair of pincer-tipped graspers.

She stood four meters tall at the shoulder, and had a pebbled skin with an iridescent green and blue sheen. A crown of richly colored feathers fringed her head and neck, trailing away from her beaked face and keen eyes. Her powerful limbs ended in five-toed feet, tipped with curved claws providing excellent purchase on the sandstone surfaces. A long tail aided in balance and agility.

10	Brezak	brezak	The light-bodied brezak is a species of large lizard with skin flaps that, when extended, allow the beast to glide on the air currents surrounding the mesas of Zygerria. Domesticated brezaks are used by the royal Zygerrian guards to patrol the ground for escaped slaves. The beast's skin flaps are anchored to a flexible rib cage that allow the brezak to spread them wide. Its flat tail serves as a rudder, giving the animal -- and a capable rider -- a remarkable degree of control in the air.

8	Battle Droid	battle-droid	Rather than use flesh-and-blood warriors, the Separatists prefer mindlessly loyal soldiers that are easily controlled. The soulless ranks of their armies are dominated by tall, thin B1 battle droids built as mechanical imitations of their Geonosian designers. Battle droids can be controlled by centralized command centers such as the Trade Federation’s enormous Droid Control Ships, or programmed for independent action. They often suffer programming glitches that manifest as personality quirks. Battle droids are dim-witted and no match for clone troopers or Jedi, but they weren’t designed to be smart – they were designed to overwhelm Republic civilians through sheer numbers, something they do very effectively.

They emerge as spheres and attach themselves to a target vessel, popping open to reveal an insect-like droid equipped with cutters and other tools of vandalism. The buzz droids are designed to disable, not destroy, enemy craft. They operate quickly, slicing into starship hulls. While their tools are effective, a hit to its central eye can knock a buzz droid out of commission.

16	Droideka	droideka	Unlike the spindly battle droids, whose humanoid builds allow them a degree of versatility, droidekas are designed with one sole function in mind: the complete annihilation of their targets. Slung at the end of heavy arms are immense twin blasters, which unleash destructive energy at a pounding pace. The destroyer droid can completely envelope itself in a globe of protective energy via its compact deflector shield generators, though at the expense of its mobility. Although slow and awkward on its three-legged gait, the droideka can transform into a much speedier, disk-shaped form.

17	Dwarf Spider Droid	dwarf-spider-droid	During the last decades of the Republic, the Jedi order had replaced any need for a unified military for protection. Instead, private interests maintained their own armed forces in local territories, and the engines of commerce could afford the most powerful and most effective armies. Despite legislation designed to curb the potency of any one private army, the massive corporations were able to build sizable droid forces. The dwarf spider droids favored by the Commerce Guild appeared in the Separatist ranks. The four-legged dome-shaped mechanical arachnid featured a powerful, centrally mounted laser cannon.

Intruders are easily spotted on the droid's many sensors, triggering evasive action in the form of homing beacons or the release of several smaller units, commonly referred to as "kids" to the main droid's "mother," that help eliminate any threat. Failing to dispatch any invading lifeform that disturbs the droid, or upon its own destruction, the First Order probe will emit a signal to scramble TIE fighters, sent immediately to take a closer look.

32	Imperial Probe Droid	imperial-probe-droid	Specially designed for deep space exploration and reconnaissance, probe droids are employed in science and military applications. Tenacious hunters and searchers, probe droids (or probots) have a variety of sensors, and the ones employed by the Empire are armed with powerful blasters and, in some models, shields. Upon arrival at their target location, they gather information. If confronted after their main mission has been completed these droids can self-destruct. Imperial probes are vaguely arachnid in shape, with a dark metal finish, bulbous sensor "eyes" and spindly manipulator arms.

1	79's	79-s	79’s was a bar located on Coruscant, particularly popular with clone troopers. While off duty, Republic soldiers would gather at the cantina to relax, drink, and blow off steam, often making rowdy toasts. When clone trooper Fives uncovered the conspiracy of Order 66, he went to 79’s in search of fellow soldier Kix, knowing that’s where his friend would most likely be.	79’s was a bar located on Coruscant, particularly popular with clone troopers.

2	Abafar	abafar	A remote world in the Outer Rim Territories, Abafar is scarcely populated. It is dominated by vast stretches of featureless desert under oppressive orange skies. The strange regolith that covers the surface twists light in such a way as to obscure shadows and leave no tracks. Particulates in the atmosphere cause the sunlight to diffuse into a uniform orange glow, so it is nearly impossible to tell direction or time of day. The huge stretches of featureless expanse are known as The Void. Pons Ora is one of the few settlements on Abafar, and it is the site of a Rhydonium mining installation operated by the Separatists during the Clone Wars.

4	Agamar	agamar	A barren world of frost and rock, Agamar was the site of a Clone Wars battle between the Republic and Separatists. Years after the end of the war, Clone War veteran Captain Rex and a band of rebels visited the planet searching for weapons, and encountered a still-active reserve of Separatist droids. The Super Tactical Droid commander demanded they have one last battle to decide the war, but the groups ultimately joined forces to take on a common enemy: the Empire.

1	The Force	the-force	The Force is a mysterious energy field created by life that binds the galaxy together. Harnessing the power of the Force gives the Jedi, the Sith, and others sensitive to this spiritual energy extraordinary abilities, such as levitating objects, tricking minds, and seeing things before they happen. While the Force can grant users powerful abilities, it also directs their actions. And it has a will of its own, which both scholars and mystics have spent millennia seeking to understand.

2	Jedi Mind Trick	jedi-mind-trick	The Force can have a powerful effect on the weak-minded, a phenomenon Jedi sometimes take advantage of in pursuing their missions. An experienced Jedi can use the Force to implant a suggestion in the minds of those they encounter, encouraging them to comply with the Jedi’s wishes.

3	Force Lightning	force-lightning	Force lightning is a dark side ability used to torture, disfigure, and even kill one’s victims. Blue in color, Sith shoot Force lightning from their hands by calling on their hatred and aggressive feelings. However, while a deadly weapon, it is not unstoppable. Force lightning can be deflected and absorbed by a lightsaber, and select Jedi have proved able to neutralize the technique through the power of the light side.

4	Force Choke	force-choke	The Force choke is another tool employed by Sith to intimidate and even kill their opponents.

7	Black Sun	black-sun	During the Clone Wars, the focus of the Jedi Knights on defeating the Separatists meant a decline of law enforcement, particularly in the sparsely patrolled Outer Rim Territories. This allowed criminal elements, like the notorious Black Sun syndicate, to flourish. The Black Sun's tentacles reach across many worlds. Many of the organization's operatives had no idea that they were benefiting Black Sun, so layered and intricate were the fronts that the syndicate hid behind. During the time of the Clone Wars, Black Sun was led by a cabal of Falleen nobles, who operated out of a well-defended fortress on Mustafar. The group’s Mustafar operations weren’t impregnable, however – Asajj Ventress and Quinlan Vos penetrated them to retrieve a family of captives taken in an underworld dispute between Black Sun and the Pyke Syndicate.

Once the bearers cleared the grid, the Podracers' massive engines would roar to life, seemingly anxious at the chance to soar at speeds exceeding 700 kilometers-per-hour. Eighteen Podracers competed to win the trophy that day. Anakin Skywalker survived to cross the finish line first, earning not only accolades, but his freedom from slavery.

When Finn meets Jannah, he is astonished and heartened to learn he wasn’t the only stormtrooper to reject his programming.	\N	t

73	Talz	talz	Orto Plutonia had long been a protectorate of the Pantoran moon, after Pantoran scouts searched the world and found no denizens amid its frozen features. They had missed the Talz population, which lived hidden in the ice canyons in villages carved out of the ice walls, filled with huts made from animal skins pulled over bone-frames. The Talz lived a simple existence, somehow subsisting off the harsh environment, and using the native narglatch cats as mounts and protection. The Talz attacked the newcomers to their world, wiping out both Republic and Separatist outposts during the Clone Wars.

78	Twi'lek	twi-lek	Twi'leks are tall, thin humanoids with skin pigment that spans a rainbow of colors. Their most distinctive feature is a pair of shapely prehensile tentacles that grow from the base of their skulls. Few things are as graceful as a female Twi'lek in motion. This beautiful image has forever doomed generations of young Twi'leks into servitude, as the wealthy and corrupt have taken to brandishing Twi'leks as badges of prestige. In the waning years of the Republic, the Twi'lek homeworld of Ryloth was represented in the Galactic Senate by the corpulent blue-skinned politician Orn Free Taa. Even a politician of high office was not above flaunting a pair of lovely Twi'lek aides as a sign of influence and wealth.

Despite their fearsome and savage countenance, Wookiees are intelligent, sophisticated, loyal and trusting. Loyalty and bravery are near-sacred tenets in Wookiee society. When peaceful, Wookiees are tender and gentle. Their tempers, however, are short; when angered, Wookiees can fly into a berserker rage and will not stop until the object of their distemper is sufficiently destroyed.

85	Zygerrian	zygerrian	The Zygerrians were a powerful people in the days of the Old Republic, before the Jedi Knights tore down their empire of slavery. When slavery was outlawed in Republic space, the Jedi Knights liberated countless beings from bondage, and the despicable trade the Zygerrians excelled in was pushed into the shadows of the underworld and beyond, with some operating in the ruins of places like Old Ord Mantell City. After the end of the Clone Wars, some Zygerrians are actively plotting a return to the old ways.

In the days of the Empire, its bustling bridge would be staffed by the finest crewers in the Imperial starfleet. Its presence in a system mark matters of extreme Imperial import. Though, as is typical of the Empire, not even the Star Destroyer was enough to sate the Imperial hunger for displays of power. Larger vessels, such as the Super Star Destroyer, dwarf even these giants.	\N	\N	\N	t
276	Imperial Troop Transport (ITT)	imperial-troop-transport-itt	The Imperial Troop Transport was used to move the Empire's soldiers from location to location, or to forcibly relocate prisoners on occupied worlds. It was developed by Ubrikkian Industries, and while not designed for combat, the vehicle is still an intimidating threat, well armed and with sturdy armor.

277	Inquisitor's TIE Advanced Prototype	inquisitor-s-tie-advanced-prototype	Tasked personally by Darth Vader with a mission to destroy all children of the Force, the Inquisitor was given access to the Empire's latest technologies. The Inquisitor's TIE Advanced prototype was superior to typical TIE fighters, featuring faster engines, S-foils with more efficient solar gather panels, upgraded laser cannons, and a projectile launcher that fired Imperial XX-23 S-Thread Tracers.

279	Jedi T-6 Shuttle	jedi-t-6-shuttle	An older design used by the Jedi Knights, the T-6 shuttle was pressed into heavier service by the necessities of the Clone Wars. The half-circle shaped ship has a rotating body, allowing for flexibility of configurations when landing on planetary surfaces or docking with starships and stations. The Jedi primarily used the T-6 as a peacetime conveyance, hence it has no weapons. The ship's reliable hyperdrive and larger interior space meant that interstellar travel in a T-6 was far more comfortable than in a cramped Jedi starfighter. In case of emergency, the ship's crew could launch ejection seats that deploy spheroid survival capsules that not only contain vital atmospheric pressure, but also cushion impact.

283	Jumpspeeder	jumpspeeder	A different form of speeder bike, jumpspeeders were originally used as emergency transports for the Jedi and military patrols. Upon the end of the Clone Wars, however, jumpspeeders were repurposed for civilian use. Sabine of the Lothal rebels drove an Undicur-class model, manufactured by Kuat Vehicles and foldable, making for easy storage.

286	Katooni (Ship)	katooni-ship	Hondo’s freighter, the Katooni, is a modified ZH-40 Tribune-class light freighter manufactured by Starfeld Industries. A relative of the older model ZH-25 Questor-class, the ZH-40 Tribune-class is equipped with quad Novaldex JV-74 engines, two paired laser cannons on the starboard size, a fixed heavy laser cannon on the port side, and four fixed laser cannons on the cargo pods (two on each tip) that can be fire-linked to quad-fire. The freighter can be flown by a single pilot, but has recommended crew stations for a total of four. Other features include a Corellian-style turret on its dorsal side, two pod-like arms that contain cargo grippers, and the capability to hold up to 85 metric tons of cargo in the mail hull. Hondo doesn't talk about where he got the freighter, but on those instances that he does, the story always changes. He does appear to have some fondness for it, some might say sentimentality.

30	Carbon-freezing	carbon-freezing	Carbon-freezing is an industrial process that encases highly pressurized gases inside solidified carbonite. In Cloud City, Darth Vader decided to freeze Luke Skywalker in carbonite for transport to the Emperor. (As Anakin Skywalker, he’d undergone the process himself to evade Separatist life detectors.) Before setting his trap for Luke, Vader tested the process on Han Solo. The smuggler survived, and was later freed by Princess Leia in Jabba’s palace, though hibernation sickness left him temporarily blind.

185	Hydroid Medusa	hydroid-medusa	Beautiful and dangerous at the same time, the Hydroid Medusa is a cybernetically enhanced biological weapon developed by the Karkarodons of Karkaris. These immense jellyfish incorporate armor and powerplants that turn them into near-unstoppable engines of underwater destruction. Separatist landing ships airdropped many Hydroid Medusas into the Mon Cala oceans during the Clone Wars, giving the Separatists the advantage in the civil war that erupted on the water world.
